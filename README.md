# 🌪️ Vortex – JavaScript Single-Player Game Collection

**Vortex** is a browser-based game hub featuring a collection of classic **single-player games**. Built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, each game is self-contained in its own folder for clean organization and modularity.

This project is ideal for learning or showcasing JavaScript-based game development.
